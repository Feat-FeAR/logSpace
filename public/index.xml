      <description>This is a concise guide on how to make a website via Hugo in a Windows environment. To this purpose, all of the following commands must be run from PowerShell (tested on PowerShell 7.3.9) and not from Windows PowerShell, which is a different application (ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±).
I recommend using PS to work in a Windows environment instead of WSL since with my ManjaroWSL2 I experienced malfunctions in page refresh. Nevertheless, 90% of the following commands also apply in a Linux/Bash environment.</description>

// JS Function Declaration function twoFold(num) { return 2 * num; }A similar syntax is also used, for instance, in Python
# Python Function Declaration def twoFold(num): return 2 * numor in MATLAB, except that, in this case, the returned value must also be indicated to the left of the = symbol in function declaration (the return keyword has a different usage here).</description>
