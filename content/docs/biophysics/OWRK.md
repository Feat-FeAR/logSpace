# Surface Free Energy - The OWRK method

## Wettability and contact angle
Wettability of surfaces by liquids is a measure of their hydrophilicity, making
it a quantity of great interest in a number of fields ranging from engineering
to biophysics, chemistry, bio(techno)logy, and medicine. Wettability can be
quantified by the so-called _contact angle_ {{< katex >}}\theta{{< /katex >}}
via the _Young equation_ applied to a sessile drop of liquid on a surface:
$$
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}-\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SL}}-\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}\cos\theta=0
$$
<div style="text-align: center;">
<br>
{{< figure src="/images/drop.png" title="sessile drop of liquid to define quantities in Young equation" width=450 >}}
</div>

where
- \\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}\\) is the solid--vapor (or gas) interfacial
	energy (aka _surface free energy_);
- \\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SL}}\\) is the solid--liquid interfacial energy;
- \\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}\\) is the liquid--vapor (or gas)
	interfacial energy (aka the _liquid surface tension_);
- \\(\theta\\) is the _contact angle_, defined as the angle between the surface
	tangent on the liquid--vapor interface and the tangent on the
	solid--liquid interface at their intersection.

A contact angle of 0째 and 180째 correspond to complete wetting and non-wetting
respectively. Surfaces exhibiting contact angles with water below 90째 are called
_hydrophilic_ and those above 90째 are called _hydrophobic_.

## Surface free energy and roughness
When designing and fabricating new materials, one is often interested in
controlling the hydrophobicity properties of their surfaces, that is, acting on
\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}\\), the term in Young equation that
represents the surface free energy.

_Surface energy_ (or _surface free energy_) quantifies the disruption of
intermolecular bonds that occurs when a surface is created. It may therefore be
defined as the _excess energy_ at the surface of a material compared to the
bulk as a result of the incomplete, unrealized bonding. It is equivalent to the
work required to build an area of a particular surface, or to cut a bulk sample,
creating two surfaces.

Cutting a solid body into pieces disrupts its bonds and increases the surface
area, and therefore increases surface energy. In general, as surface energy
increases, the contact angle decreases because more of the liquid is being
"grabbed" by the surface. Conversely, as surface energy decreases, the contact
angle increases, because the surface doesn't want to interact with the liquid.

For the same reason, surface roughness usually has a strong effect on the
contact angle and wettability of a surface. More specifically, the effect of
roughness depends on if the droplet will wet the surface grooves or if air
pockets will be left between the droplet and the surface. If the surface is
wetted homogeneously, the droplet is in _Wenzel state_ and adding surface
roughness will enhance the wettability caused by the chemistry of the surface. 

## The OWRK method
There are several different models for calculating the surface free energy based
on the contact angle readings. The most commonly used method is the Owens,
Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble (OWRK) method, which based on a two-component model to
separate the interfacial tension according to the underlying interactions
between the molecules. These interactions are defined as _polar_ (\\(P\\)) and
_dispersive_ (\\(D\\)) interactions, and the total surface energy, both for a
solid and a liquid, is the sum of the two parts.
{{< katex display >}}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}=\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}+\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}\\
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}=\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}+\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}
\end{aligned}
\right.
{{< /katex >}}
The polar interactions arise due to the permanent dipole--permanent dipole
interactions (or Keesom forces). They are stronger and only exist in polar
molecules. Dispersive component (also known as London forces) are weak and arise
due to random fluctuations in the electron density in an electron cloud and
hence lead to temporary/induced dipole interactions.

As for the solid-liquid interfacial energy
(\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SL}}\\)), the OWRK method resorts to Good's
equation, for which
$$
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SL}}=\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}+\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}-2\left(\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}}+\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}}\right)
$$
Combining Young and Good's equations to eliminate the
\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SL}}\\) term, and renaming
\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{LG}}\equiv\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}\\) and
\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{SG}}\equiv\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}\\) for
ease of notation, we get the following relation:
$$
\frac{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}\left(1+\cos\theta\right)}{2\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}}}=\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}}\sqrt{\frac{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}}{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}}}+\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}}
$$
If the surface tension of the liquid is known in both its components
\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}\\) and
\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}\\), the above equation
is a linear equation of the form \\(y=mx+q\\) in which \\(x\\) is known as well,
while \\(y\\) can be drawn by contact angle measurement. In OWRK method, __the
contact angle of the surface is measured with several (at least two) liquids__
so that the slope and vertical intercept of the line can be calculated to
estimate the polar and dispersive components of the surface free energy,
respectively.
{{< katex display >}}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}} & =m^2\\
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}} & =q^2
\end{aligned}
\right.
{{< /katex >}}

To get two properly spaced points on the plane, two liquids with markedly
different surface tension properties are usually used, namely water and
diiodomethane (aka _methylene iodide_, MI), with the following reference values:

| Solvent |\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}\\) (mN/m)<sup>1</sup>|\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}\\) (mN/m)|\\(\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}\\) (mN/m)|\\(x\\)|
|:-------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
| __Water__           | 43.70 | 29.10 | 72.80 | 1.23 |
| __Diiodomethane__   |  2.60 | 47.40 | 50.00 | 0.23 |
| __Ethylene Glycol__ | 21.30 | 26.40 | 47.70 | 0.81 |

<p style="font-size:12px;">
	<sup>1</sup> The surface energy is usually measured in units of joules per
	square meter (J/m<sup>2</sup>), which is equivalent in the case of liquids
	to surface tension, usually measured in newtons per meter (N/m).
</p>

In summary, for each surface \\(S\\) subjected to surface free energy
measurement by sessile drop technique, a regression line of this type needs to
be calculated:

## Uncertainty estimation
Typically, the surface tension values of the probe liquids used in the sessile
drop test are known in the literature with such a precision that they can be
assumed to be without uncertainty. Therefore, the x-values in the above graph
are also assumed error-free. In contrast, empirical measurements of contact
angles usually come with an uncertainty \\(s_\theta\\) resulting from the stochastic
fluctuations of \\(\theta\\), which is measured \\(n\\) times. This uncertainty
propagates to the \\(y\\) variable according to the usual rule:
$$
s_y=\sqrt{\left[\frac{d}{d\theta}\frac{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}\left(1+\cos\theta\right)}{2\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}}}\right]^{2}s_{\theta}^{2}}=\frac{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}\sin\theta}{2\sqrt{\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{L}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}}}\ s_{\theta}\qquad\textrm{with}\quad\theta\in\left[0,\pi\right]
$$
{{< hint danger >}}
It is extremely important here to make sure that all the angles are expressed in
__radians__, with special attention to the value of \\(s_\theta\\) !!

### Two probe liquids
When only two probe liquids are used, \\(s_{y}\\) represents the only source of
uncertainty, since the interpolation of two points by a line is always exact. In
that case it is necessary to propagate the uncertainty on the slope and
intercept estimators, but instead of starting from the general formulas of
linear regression for ordinary least squares (OLS) minimization, with just two
experimental points (e.g., water and diiodomethane) we can use the simpler
relations
{{< katex display >}}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
m & =\frac{y_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}-y_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}}{x_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}-x_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}}\\
q & =y_{i}-m\,x_{i}
\end{aligned}
\right.\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
s_m & =\frac{1}{\left|x_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}-x_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}\right|}\sqrt{s_{y\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}^2+s_{y\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}^2}\\
s_q & =x_{i}\ s_m
\end{aligned}
\right.
{{< /katex >}}
where possible correlations between \\(y_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}\\) and
\\(y_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}\\) have been neglected (assumption of independent
variables), and \\(i\\) is either \\(\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}\\) or
\\(\scriptscriptstyle{MI}\\). Actually, \\(\left(x_i,y_i\right)\\) can be _any_
point of the line, including \\(\left(\bar{x},\bar{y}\right)\\) or
\\(\left(x_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}-x_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}},y_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}-y_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}\right)\\).

Of course,
{{< katex display >}}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
s_{\gamma\scriptscriptstyle{P}} & =2m\,s_m\\
s_{\gamma\scriptscriptstyle{D}} & =2q\,s_q
\end{aligned}
\right.\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
s_{\gamma}=2\sqrt{m^{2}\,s_{m}^{2}+q^{2}\,s_{q}^{2}}
{{< /katex >}}


## Hydrophobic surfaces
For some of the more hydrophobic surfaces, the slope of the fitted line can even
return negative values, meaning that the surface is so hydrophobic that only the
dispersive component is actually relevant to the surface energy calculation. In
these cases, a slope of zero is usually assumed
$$
\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{P}}\simeq0\quad\Rightarrow\quad\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}\simeq\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle{S}}^{\scriptscriptstyle{D}}
$$
and a horizontal line is fitted instead:
$$
q=\frac{y_{\scriptscriptstyle{H_{2}O}}+y_{\scriptscriptstyle{MI}}}{2}
$$
