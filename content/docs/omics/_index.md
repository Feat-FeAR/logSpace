# Omics Data


{{< SubIndexGenerator >}}

Omics data refer to the __large-scale datasets__ generated from the study of the
different types of biological molecules that make up an organism, by the use of
__high-throughput technologies__, such as sequencing, mass spectrometry, and
chromatography. Hence, omics technologies provide a __holistic__ view of
biological systems by analyzing large-scale data on genes (_genomics_), proteins
(_proteomics_), RNA transcripts (_transcriptomics_), metabolites
(_metabolomics_), and other molecules. This comprehensive perspective helps
scientists understand the interactions and functions of various biomolecules in
a system and, even if the integration of data from different biological layers
is still an ongoing challenge, the analysis of omics data has already
transformed biosciences by providing deeper insights into the molecular
foundations of life and disease, ultimately leading to advancements in research,
diagnostics, and treatments.

### Resources
In this section you can find a collection of notes to the most important and
most frequently used (by me) web resources for accessing, analyzing, and storing
omics data.
